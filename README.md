# Statistical Consulting Capstone Project

Collaborated with UCLA classmates on final project for our statistical consulting capstone course, from February to March 2024.

This project involved working with real-world clients on a statistical consulting problem. This repo includes the cleaned data and the documentation of what went into working with this data, but for privacy reasons will not include any analysis of the findings within context.
